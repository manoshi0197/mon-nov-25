                    <p class=".text-body contact3"><em>The 'O' blood type is also commonly known as the "Universal
                            blood type" or the "universal donor," because it contains neither A nor B antigens on the
                            red blood cells. However, there are both A and B antibodies in the blood plasma. As a
                            result, this type of blood can be used as an infusion to give to individuals with any blood
                            type. Nonetheless, due to the presence of antibodies in the blood plasma, the term
                            "universal blood type" is now somewhat contested. Blood type-related complications in blood
                            transfusions may still occur if there is an issue with the 'O' type blood's antibodies.
                            Given the patterns of genetic inheritance that determine blood type, 'O' type blood is
                            relatively uncommon, compared with A or B type blood. 'O'-type blood may be further divided
                            into Rh+ and Rh-, also known as O+ and O-. This distinction refers to the presence or
                            absence of Rh proteins on the red blood cells.</em> </p>

                    <p class=".text-body contact3"><em>The 'A' blood type contains 'A' type agglutinogens, a type of
                            antigen. These antigens are present in the red blood cells of the 'A'-type blood.
                            Individuals with the 'A' blood type have the 'B'-type antibody in their blood plasma. In
                            addition, the red blood cells of 'A'-type blood may contain Rh proteins on the cell
                            surface. If this Rh protein is present, the blood is categorized as 'A+'. If it is lacking,
                            the blood is 'A-'. With regard to blood transfusions, individuals with 'A' blood type may
                            donate their blood to individuals with 'A' or 'AB' blood types. Patients with Rh+ blood may
                            receive either Rh+ or Rh- blood, but not vice-versa. (If you have Rh- blood, you can only
                            receive a transfusion of Rh- blood.)</em> </p>

                            antigens in the red blood cells and by 'A'-type antibodies in the plasma. As in the case of
                            'A' or 'O'-type blood, an individual with a 'B' blood type may be Rh+ or Rh-, depending on
                            whether there are Rh proteins on the red blood cells. Individuals with 'B' blood type may

                    <p class=".text-body contact3"><em>The 'AB' blood type, also known as the "universal receiver"
                            blood type, contains both the A and B antigens on the red blood cells, but contains neither
                            A or B antibodies in the plasma. As a result, individuals with the 'AB' blood type may
                            receive transfusions of any kind of blood. However, they can only donate their blood for
                            use by other individuals of the 'AB' blood type. The 'AB' blood type is produced when the
                            alleles, or genetic indicators, of the mother and father are each 'A' and 'B'. Instead of
                            one type dominating the other, and causing the child to be either 'A' or 'B' type, they are
                            both present, to produce 'AB'-type blood. Despite the common use of the term "universal
                            receiver" for AB type blood, the name may be somewhat deceiving. In addition to the A and B
                            antigens that determine a person's blood type by the ABO system, human blood actually
                            contains hundreds of antigens. In most cases, the presence of these other antigens is quite
                            uniform throughout the human population. However, in some unusual cases, an individual may
                            be lacking a particular antigen. In these rare cases, even an individual with an 'AB' blood
                            type may not be able to receive a transfusion of 'AB' blood. As with 'A', 'B' or 'O' blood
                            types, the 'AB' blood type may be either Rh+ or Rh-.</em> </p>
